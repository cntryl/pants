# Storage I/O Boundaries

Pants centralizes metadata replacement in `AtomicStagedFile`. The helper writes
a uniquely named file in the target directory, flushes that file to stable
storage, invokes any injected pre-publication failure, atomically renames it
over the target, and flushes the parent directory on Unix. Temporary cleanup
is best-effort; uncertain targets are never deleted.

Windows does not expose a supported directory-flush handle through
`System.IO`. On Windows, Pants uses a write-through file handle, an explicit
file flush, and a same-volume atomic move—the strongest portable BCL
durability boundary. Unix additionally flushes the directory entry after the
move.

The lease mutation-lock file is intentionally the one exception to staged
replacement. Its atomic `CreateNew` at the final path is the mutual-exclusion
primitive itself; publishing it by rename would allow multiple contenders to
prepare ownership simultaneously. SST flush staging and WAL rotation likewise
retain their recovery-specific immutable naming protocols rather than using a
metadata replacement helper.

WAL frames and manifest-journal records use positional, vectored writes through
`System.IO.RandomAccess`. SST point-read bytes are loaded through positional
reads rather than a shared mutable `FileStream.Position`. These primitives
avoid cursor contention and keep offsets explicit at persistence boundaries.
